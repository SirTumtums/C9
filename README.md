# C9
Challenge 9 Repo


## Description
This code was created to make a way to generate a README.md file from the terminal. This streamlines the process for contibutors to know what they are working with and aloows them to get straight to contributing. The README is very basic while still containing the main information set that you'd expect to receive in a README file. This is accomplished by the prompts that are given to new users.
